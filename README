What This Is
------------

This is a program that checks whether all the basic programming stuff is
installed in a computer.

I like to change computers a lot, and many of them do not have the adequate
things installed (such as gcc) in order to code immediately. As such, I made
this so that I can streamline the process of finding out what is missing.

I hope this is helpful to me. If it is, then I hope it is also helpful to you.

Using Make
----------

Before anything, run "make". If you can't... set it up.
